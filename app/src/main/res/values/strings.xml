    <string name="info_1">The Pomodoro Technique can help you power through distractions, hyper-focus, and get things done in short bursts, while taking frequent breaks to come up for air and relax.</string>
    <string name="info_2">Here is how to get started with Pomodoro, in five steps:\n
\n
1. Choose a task to be accomplished.\n
\n
2. Divide it in smaller tasks able to be acomplished in a short period of time.\n
\n
2. Set the Pomodoro to your selected time in minutes (the classic is 25 minutes).\n
\n
3. Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings. Pomodoro will take care of the count for you.\n
\n
4. Take a short break (5 minutes is OK, but you can take more depending on how long your sessions are).\n
\n
5. Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break</string>
